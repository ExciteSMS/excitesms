```dart
// Initialize ExciteSMS with your API key
final exciteSMS = ExciteSMS('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Define the SMS details
final recipient = '+1234567890'; // Recipient's phone number
final senderId = 'MyApp'; // Sender ID (your application name)
final message = 'Hello, ExciteSMS!';

// Send the SMS
try {
  await exciteSMS.sendSMS(recipient, senderId, message);
  print('SMS sent successfully.');
} catch (e) {
  print('Failed to send SMS: $e');
}
```

Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your ExciteSMS API key.
